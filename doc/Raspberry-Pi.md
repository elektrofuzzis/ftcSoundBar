# Raspberry PI using wifi & Phyton

Raspberry Pi users could use the python interface to program the ftcSoundBar:

* Download phython library fom this repo.
* Connect TX-PI and ftcSoundBar to your local wifi.
* Use the python library to write your code.

**Remarks:**

* The library is very general. So it's working fine on every computer, which has a wifi connection and a python Intepreter.
* The raspberry pi has a i²c-bus-interface. You could use this interface, too. But you need to implement the i²c api on your own.
