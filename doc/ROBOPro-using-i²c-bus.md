# TXT controller using roboPro & I2C

To connect the ftcSoundBar via iÂ²c-bus, you just need to connect a 1:1 ribbon cable between TXT extention port and ftcSoundBar's I2C interface at the right side. 

- Checkout `robopro` folder
- Try `ftcSoundBar_I2C_Example.rpp` to play some songs.
- Store `robopro/lib/ftcSoundBarI2C.rpp` in your ROBOPro's library folder, so you could use it in your own project.

*MAC-Users: `ftcSoundBarI2C.rpp` is working fine with Parallels and Wine.*
